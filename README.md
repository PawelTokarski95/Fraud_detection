# Fraud_detection

- **Language**: Python

In this project, I performed fraud detection prediction based on data initially processed using PCA. The data comes from Kaggle. After making predictions with XGBoost, which is one of the most effective machine learning algorithms, I deployed the model using FastAPI. Then, I uploaded it to the Amazon AWS EC2 cloud. The model achieved very high results.
